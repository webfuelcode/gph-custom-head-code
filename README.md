## 💡 Lightweight `<head>` Code Injector

We built this plugin out of necessity - most solutions for injecting code into the `<head>` are bloated, complex, or packed with features we didn’t need.

This plugin keeps things simple and focused:
Just a clean, minimal way to insert your custom code into the `<head>` tag - no setup overwhelm, no feature overload.

Perfect for:

* Adding meta tags
* Analytics scripts
* Custom styles or fonts
* Any small code snippets

🪶 *Because sometimes all you need is a light, focused tool that just works.*

     * Custom CSS or font links
